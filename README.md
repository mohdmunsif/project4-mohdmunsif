# Project 4

ToysForYou


The app is meant for parents to find suitable age-appropriate toys for their kids, with other users recommending toys and reviews.


1. User Registration, 2. User Login (all validation included). 3. Page to submit toy recommendation (with age range), and possibly link to buy such toy


All the previous ones, + 4. feature to upload user photos


all the previous ones, + 5. usual user/login feature, security stuff (all link is guarded), authentication, password reset, 6. I do not know how to do this yet, but upon submission of URL from Walmart, or Amazon perhaps, some snippet of the URL will be stored and displayed (like how Facebook snippet works for links)



Need to research what Python framework would help me the most - right now my mindset is still on Flask but as i go along with Django, i might choose it if i think it would make the most sense based on its feature vs flask. New skills: development a proper webapp using Django or Flask, with user uploading stuff
